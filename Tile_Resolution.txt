Resolution

SNES version had 32 tiles across and 28 tiles vertically.



In contrast,
MicropolisJ, full screen, at 32px resolution, has 29 tiles across (plus a
huge amount of real-estate taken up by the tool bar and mini-map) and 24
tiles vertically.


In conclusion, I think 32px tiles are a bit big but closer to an ideal
resolution than 16px tiles.
